.. sets the text align, background color, padding, margin, justifcaiton, text align and displays everything inside it in the block orientaiton.

 ## Custom JavaScript Functions
```  
The Javascript is the slideshow of images under the video.
The javascript functions I created are:
 1. function name transition();
.. function checks to see if i is less than the .length of the variable imgArray, if it is then one is added to the index variable i, and that is used to display the next image in the array.  If the image is greater than the length of the array, I is set back to zero.
